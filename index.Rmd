title: "Index of SMS persuasion supplement"
---

# Welcome!

This site is a supplementary web page to a trial, where we tried to change people's behaviour by simple or rationale-providing (using the word "because") SMS reminders.

The project is based on my master's thesis [available on OSF](https://osf.io/ncevp/); link to the manuscript preprint will be added later.

See [mattiheino.com](www.mattiheino.com) for my primary blog. A post on this study can be found [here](https://mattiheino.com/2016/05/03/myth-of-the-magical-because/).
